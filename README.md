# BritishAirwaysCustomerAnalytics
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks: one focusing on sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and data visualizations of British Airways reviews, and the other on predictive modeling of customer booking behavior.
Let's start by adjusting the README based on your comments:

## Overview

- Topic Modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Data Visualization using pie charts, bar charts, and word clouds.

## Key Findings
